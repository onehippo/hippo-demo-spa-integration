Check [Hippo CMS Release Notes](https://www.onehippo.org/about/release-notes/release-notes-overview.html).

## Build Demo CMS project

**Note**: If you are a developer and want to build with SNAPSHOT version in ```develop``` branch, then you should append
```-Dhippo.snapshots``` in each Maven command shown below.

There are two editions: (a) Community Edition and (b) Enterprise Edition.

Demo CMS project community edition shows how SPAs can be integrated in Delivery tier.

Demo CMS project enterprise edition shows how SPAs can be integrated in Channel Manager in addition.

Each edition is differentiated by the project's parent POM dependency.
So, before building CMS project, you need to build/install a proper parent POM project first as instructed below.

### Build Demo CMS Project community edition

First, build/install Demo CMS project community edition's parent POM project like the following:

```bash
$ mvn -f parent-pom/community/pom.xml install
```

Second, build Demo CMS project community edition like the following:

```bash
$ mvn clean verify
```

### Build the Demo CMS Project enterprise edition

First, build/install Demo CMS project enterprise edition's parent POM project like the following:

```bash
$ mvn -f parent-pom/enterprise/pom.xml install
```

Second, build Demo CMS project enterprise edition with ```-Denterprise``` system property like the following:

```bash
$ mvn clean verify -Denterprise
```

The ```-Denterprise``` system property lets it pull in all the necessary enterprise modules.

## Run Demo CMS project

Build and install the demo like the following:

```bash
    $ mvn -P cargo.run
```

## Run Demo SPAs

Reference implementations for Angular and React are available. See instructions below on how to install and run them.

## Run Demo React app

To install and start the React application using NPM, run the following commands
(you can skip `npm install` if you have ever installed the dependencies before):

```bash
$ cd spa/react
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

You should now be able to access the React app in delivery tier at http://localhost:8080/site/ or http://localhost:3000.

## Run Demo Angular app

To install and run the Angular application using NPM, run the following commands:
(you can skip `npm install` if you have ever installed the dependencies before):
```bash
$ cd spa/angular
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

You should now be able to access the Angular app at http://localhost:3000.

Before viewing the site in the CMS, please note that you have to change the front-end renderer in the CMS (default is 
React):
* Login to the CMS and go to the Channel Manager
* Click on Channel > Settings > Select Angular from the front-end framework dropdown
* Click Save, and then Channel > Publish

The site should now be viewable in the CMS and in the delivery tier at http://localhost:8080/site.


## (Enterprise Edition Only) Test Channel Manager Integration

If you build and run Demo CMS project enterprise edition, then visit the Channel Manager by selecting **Channels** perspective after logging in CMS at http://localhost:8080/cms/, and select the default channel to manage.

You will be able to set component parameters, add, remove or drag&drop components in SPA.


## (For Project Maintainers Only) Tagging Process

For tagging processes, follow [Hippo Forge Release Process](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/release-process.html)
and the principles mentioned there
with the following exceptions:
- When bumping up project versions, bump up the versions for both [parent-pom/community](parent-pom/community) and
  [parent-pom/enterprise](parent-pom/enterprise) as well.
- Also, bump up the parent element's version in the root pom.xml as it points to either parent pom dependency in the previous step.
- As this project is just a demo, do not deploy to Maven repositories.
